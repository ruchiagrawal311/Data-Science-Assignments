    "Ans:- Feature extraction is the process of identifying and extracting important features from data. In the context of CNNs, features are typically extracted from images. This is done by using a series of convolutional layers, which are responsible for detecting patterns in the image data. The output of the convolutional layers is a set of feature maps, which represent the different features that have been detected in the image. These feature maps are then used by the fully connected layers to classify the image or to perform other tasks."
